'''
The dot before models means current directory or current application. Both views.py and models.py are in the same directory. This means we can use . and the name of the file (without .py). Then we import the name of the model (Post).

# Create your views here
def post_list(request):
    posts = Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now()).order_by('published_date')
    return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {'posts': posts})

'''
	As you can see, we created a function (def) called post_list that takes request and return a function render that will render (put together) our template blog/post_list.html.
